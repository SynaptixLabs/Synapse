# E2E — real-Chromium checks (Playwright)

Per the E2E doctrine (`.claude/policies/e2e-doctrine.md`): a real browser via `page.goto()`,
visibility assertions, screenshots to `../screenshots/`. Never `request.get()`.

## Running

```bash
./start.sh                      # live stack with an ingested vault (run ingest once)
npm i -D playwright && npx playwright install chromium   # one-time, anywhere convenient
node tests/e2e/sprint01_dashboard.spec.mjs               # acceptance flow: ingest×2, invariance, index
node tests/e2e/sprint01_wiki_popup.spec.mjs              # wiki popup: wikilink nav, infobox, Esc
```

Both scripts exit non-zero on failure and drop screenshots into `tests/screenshots/`.
They run against the LIVE dev stack (the founder's actual acceptance path). They are
vault-agnostic: `E2E_FILTER` (default `alpha` — a note that exists in the committed fixture
repos, and therefore also in any vault that ingested this repo) picks the note used for the
filter/navigation steps.

**CI:** the `e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs all three specs against a FIXTURE
vault (repo_a + repo_b) with real Chromium. Opt-in via repo variable `ENABLE_E2E_CI=true` —
kept off the always-on path because it needs a browser download + a live stack (~2–3 min).
Screenshots are uploaded as the `explorer-e2e-evidence` artifact.
