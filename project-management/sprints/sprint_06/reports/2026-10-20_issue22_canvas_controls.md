# Issue #22 - canvas control layout

Owner: Codex (`dev` for implementation; `cpto` for the separate GBU pass).
Base: `0267d5215fc332ecdb15fead63baa7339b7139b6`.

## Acceptance and reuse

Opening Explorer must leave reset, path, type filters, sort, and sidebar controls independently
clickable as the viewport and sidebars resize.

EXTEND the existing `frontend/index.html` control layout and standalone Playwright conventions.
Reuse the existing reset/path handlers, type pills, lens, and graph debugging seams.
No new component, API, design token, provider, or storage contract is needed.

## Plan (before implementation)

1. Add the missing `frontend/README.md` required by the reuse-first policy.
2. Add a failing real-Chromium regression under `tests/e2e/` for the overlapping controls.
   Cover narrow and wide viewports, expanded/collapsed sidebars, and actual state changes.
3. Fix the existing canvas layout in `frontend/index.html` without changing its visual tokens.
4. Document the regression command in `tests/e2e/README.md` and the fix in `CHANGELOG.md`;
   include the regression in the existing opt-in E2E workflow.
5. Run the new regression, relevant existing Explorer specs, backend tests, frontend build,
   and adapter checks. Record actual results and limits here; perform the GBU review under
   `../reviews/` before submitting a PR.

## Test environment

Use an isolated fixture vault and env file, loopback-only servers, and
`SYNAPSE_MOCK_MODELS=1`. No personal sources or paid calls.
Browser plugin not available; use the repository's Playwright/Chromium workflow.

## Results

- Before the fix, real Chromium showed the type/sort tools covering reset/path at 390 and
  1024 px. The test-first regression failed on the reset button's obstructed hit target.
- After the fix: `node tests/e2e/canvas_controls.spec.mjs` ->
  `PASS: canvas controls independently clickable in 17 viewport/sidebar cases`.
  Widths: 390, 1024, 1280, 1500, 1920 px; desktop also collapses/restores the sidebars and
  drags the menu divider. Actual clicks assert reset feedback, path arming/disarming, note-type
  filtering, and sort selection/results. Nine interior hit probes per button plus canvas
  bounds catch partial overlap/clipping; page identity, meaningful note counts, absence of a
  Vite overlay, and browser error logs are also checked.
- Existing real-Chromium specs passed: `sprint02_explorer` (including drag/pin/reset),
  `sprint04_open_brain` (actual note clicks produce a one-hop path), `sprint05_lens`,
  `sprint06_lens`, and `sprint03_distill_render` (mock summary/image). The new 17-case
  regression also passed with the additional mock-generated summary pill.
- Full backend gate: `SYNAPSE_MOCK_MODELS=1 ./start.sh test` on an isolated WSL Ubuntu 24.04
  ext4 copy, Python 3.12.3 -> `305 passed in 2.14s`.
- Windows Python 3.11.9: `python -m pytest -q` -> 300 passed, 5 failed. The exact same five
  tests fail on the unmodified base above (executable mode, newline handling, `os.geteuid`,
  long filenames, and symlink privileges). This is not a Windows full-suite pass; no system
  settings or backend code were changed to hide the failures.
- `npm run build` passed (Node 24.16.0, locked Vite 7.3.6).
- Both adapter checks passed; the self-test caught all nine intentional drift fixtures.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Review follow-up plan

The automated review of `2364b69` found that the stretched transparent toolbar still intercepts
graph gestures in its unused space. Extend the existing browser regression first to require
canvas hit targets and wheel zoom through that space, then make only the wrapper ignore pointer
events while restoring them on buttons and the lens menu. Update this report and the GBU record
after rerunning the browser regression and build.

Follow-up result: the added test failed on `2364b69` with `hit: canvasTools` rather than
`graph` in a toolbar gap. After disabling pointer events on the wrapper and restoring them
only on buttons and the lens menu, all 17 cases passed, including actual wheel zoom through
the unused toolbar area. The existing Explorer spec (drag/pin/reset) and frontend build also
passed again. Backend/provider code is unchanged, so its earlier 305-pass Linux result was
not rerun or represented as a new run. The review conversation remains for the reviewer.

## Screenshot evidence and limits

Playwright 1.64.1 drove Chromium at `http://localhost:5173/` against a loopback fixture backend.
Per-case PNGs are generated under ignored `tests/screenshots/canvas-controls-*.png`.
Before/after screenshots are attached to the PR rather than committed as stale PNGs.

The existing mobile topbar overflows at 390 px (visible in the before screenshot too); this
canvas-control fix does not redesign it. Chromium is the browser verified here; Firefox and
WebKit are untested. The complete historical E2E collection was not run.
Hosted CI, the optional E2E job, and maintainer review remain separate gates; no workflow
approval, repository setting, or auto-merge change is part of this work.

Implementation, testing, and the GBU pass were performed by an autonomous Codex agent.
No human review or manual verification is claimed.
